#+TITLE: avride

The purpose of this project is to have a simple contenerized setup for avr programming. It starts an lsp server that can be used by any editor supporting lsp over a remote connection (only tested on emacs).

To start the environment for the first time : 
#+begin_src bash
./startenv.sh
#+end_src

You know have pod named avride that you can manipulate like any pod (you can stop/restart/start/kill it).
